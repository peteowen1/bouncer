\arguments{
\item{wpa_data}{data.frame with delivery-level WPA data}

\item{role}{Character. Filter by role: "batting", "bowling", or "both"}

\item{group_by}{Character vector. Grouping variables (default: player only).
Can include "season", "match_type" for additional grouping.}

data.frame with aggregated WPA statistics:
\itemize{
\item player_id: Player identifier
\item role: "batting" or "bowling"
\item matches: Number of matches
\item deliveries: Total deliveries
\item total_wpa: Career/season total WPA
\item wpa_per_delivery: Average WPA per delivery
\item wpa_per_match: Average WPA per match

\title{Calculate Centrality-Based ELO Regression}
\usage{
calculate_centrality_regression(
  current_elo,
  player_centrality_percentile,
  elo_start = THREE_WAY_ELO_START,
  elo_per_percentile = CENTRALITY_ELO_PER_PERCENTILE,
  regression_strength = CENTRALITY_REGRESSION_STRENGTH
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_elo}{Numeric. The player's current ELO rating after normal update.}

\item{player_centrality_percentile}{Numeric. The player's centrality percentile (0-100).
If NULL or NA, no regression is applied.}

\item{elo_start}{Numeric. Base ELO (default THREE_WAY_ELO_START = 1400).}

\item{elo_per_percentile}{Numeric. ELO points per percentile point (default 6).}

\item{regression_strength}{Numeric. Pull strength per delivery (default 0.005).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The ELO correction to ADD to current_elo (can be negative).
}
\description{
Applies a continuous "gravity" pull toward the player's centrality-implied ELO.
This creates a stronger Bayesian prior that prevents low-centrality players from
accumulating inflated ratings by dominating weak opponents in isolated ecosystems.
}
\details{
The regression is proportional to the gap between current ELO and implied ELO:
correction = regression_strength × (implied_elo - current_elo)

This means:
\itemize{
\item Players far above their implied ELO are pulled down more strongly
\item Players near their implied ELO experience minimal correction
\item Elite players (high centrality) have higher implied ELOs, so their high ratings
are "justified" by their network position
}
}
\examples{
# Low centrality player with inflated ELO
calculate_centrality_regression(2400, 5)   # -6.35 (strong pull down)

# Elite player with high ELO
calculate_centrality_regression(2000, 95)  # -1.65 (small pull down, justified)

# Average player at average ELO
calculate_centrality_regression(1400, 50)  # 0 (no correction needed)

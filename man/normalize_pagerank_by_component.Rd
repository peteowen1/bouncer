\title{Normalize PageRank by Component Size}
\usage{
normalize_pagerank_by_component(
  pagerank_scores,
  player_component,
  component_sizes,
  penalty_exponent = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pagerank_scores}{Named numeric vector of PageRank scores.}

\item{player_component}{Named vector mapping player_id to component ID.}

\item{component_sizes}{Named vector of component sizes.}

\item{penalty_exponent}{Numeric. Exponent for size penalty (default 0.5).
Higher values penalize small components more aggressively.}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector of normalized PageRank scores.
}
\description{
Applies a penalty to PageRank scores based on connected component size.
Players in small isolated clusters get their scores reduced proportionally,
fixing the issue where isolated clusters have artificially inflated PageRank.
}
\details{
The normalization formula is:
normalized_pr = raw_pr * (component_size / max_component_size) ^ exponent

With exponent = 0.5:
\itemize{
\item Main component (3000 players): multiplier = 1.0
\item Medium cluster (300 players): multiplier = 0.32
\item Small cluster (30 players): multiplier = 0.10
}
}

Description: Advanced cricket analytics featuring a novel player ELO rating system.
    Calculates batting and bowling ELO ratings at the ball-by-ball level, with
    multi-dimensional ratings (overall, format-specific, opposition-adjusted).
    Provides expected runs and wicket probability predictions for any batter-bowler
    matchup, accounting for context (venue, match phase, conditions). Includes
    data management functions to download and parse cricket data from Cricsheet,
    storing it in a DuckDB database for efficient querying.

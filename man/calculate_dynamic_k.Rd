\title{Calculate Dynamic K-Factor}
\usage{
calculate_dynamic_k(experience, k_max, k_min, halflife)
}
\arguments{
\item{experience}{Numeric. Player/entity experience count (deliveries, matches, etc.)}

\item{k_max}{Numeric. Maximum K-factor for new players.}

\item{k_min}{Numeric. Minimum K-factor for experienced players.}

\item{halflife}{Numeric. Experience value at which K is halfway between max and min.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The calculated K-factor.
}
\description{
Computes a K-factor that decays exponentially with experience.
New players start with higher K (learn quickly), experienced players
have lower K (more stable ratings).
}
\details{
Formula: K = k_min + (k_max - k_min) * exp(-experience / halflife)

This function consolidates the K-factor decay pattern that was repeated
in player_elo_dynamic.R, team_elo_optimization.R, and three_way_elo.R.
}
\examples{
# Player K-factors (using T20 defaults)
calculate_dynamic_k(0, k_max = 200, k_min = 15, halflife = 500)    # 200 (new)
calculate_dynamic_k(500, k_max = 200, k_min = 15, halflife = 500)  # ~107.5 (half)
calculate_dynamic_k(5000, k_max = 200, k_min = 15, halflife = 500) # ~15 (experienced)

# Team K-factors
calculate_dynamic_k(0, k_max = 60, k_min = 20, halflife = 50)      # 60 (new team)
calculate_dynamic_k(100, k_max = 60, k_min = 20, halflife = 50)    # ~26.5

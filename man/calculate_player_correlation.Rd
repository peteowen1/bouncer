\item{player_a}{First player ID}

\item{player_b}{Second player ID}

\item{player_opponents}{List mapping player_id -> vector of opponent_ids}

\item{player_events}{List mapping player_id -> vector of event_names}

\item{player_matchups}{List mapping player_id -> list(opponent_id -> count)}

\item{w_opponents}{Weight for shared opponents (default 0.5)}

\item{w_events}{Weight for same events (default 0.3)}

\item{w_direct}{Weight for direct matches (default 0.2)}
}
\value{
Numeric correlation score between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Computes a hybrid correlation score based on:
\itemize{
\item Shared opponents (Jaccard similarity of opponent sets)
\item Same events (Jaccard similarity of event sets)
\item Direct matches (proportion of matches against each other)
}
}

For batters, "opponents" means bowlers faced.
For bowlers, "opponents" means batters bowled to.

\title{Build Matchup Matrices from Deliveries Data}
\usage{
build_pagerank_matrices(
  deliveries,
  format = "all",
  min_deliveries = PAGERANK_MIN_DELIVERIES
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deliveries}{Data frame with columns: batter_id, bowler_id, runs_batter,
is_wicket_delivery (or player_out_id), match_type.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format filter: "t20", "odi", "test", or "all".}

\item{min_deliveries}{Integer. Minimum deliveries for a player to be included.
Default uses PAGERANK_MIN_DELIVERIES constant.}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item matchup_matrix: Sparse matrix of delivery counts (batter x bowler)
\item performance_matrix: Normalized runs/ball (0-1 scale)
\item wicket_matrix: Wicket proportions (0-1 scale)
\item batter_ids: Character vector of batter IDs (row names)
\item bowler_ids: Character vector of bowler IDs (col names)
\item batter_deliveries: Named vector of total deliveries faced
\item bowler_deliveries: Named vector of total deliveries bowled

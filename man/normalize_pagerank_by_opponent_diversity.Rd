\title{Normalize PageRank by Opponent Diversity}
\usage{
normalize_pagerank_by_opponent_diversity(
  pagerank_scores,
  unique_opponent_counts,
  penalty_exponent = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pagerank_scores}{Named numeric vector of PageRank scores.}

\item{unique_opponent_counts}{Named vector of unique opponent counts for each player.}

\item{penalty_exponent}{Numeric. Exponent for diversity penalty (default 0.3).
Higher values penalize low-diversity players more aggressively.}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector of normalized PageRank scores.
}
\description{
Applies a penalty to PageRank scores based on the number of unique opponents faced.
Players in isolated clusters face few unique opponents and get penalized,
fixing the issue where isolated subgroups have inflated PageRank rankings.
}
\details{
The normalization formula is:
normalized_pr = raw_pr * (unique_opps / max_unique_opps) ^ exponent

With exponent = 0.3:
\itemize{
\item Kohli (429 unique bowlers, max ~600): penalty ~ 0.93
\item Taranjit (23 unique bowlers): penalty ~ 0.45
}

This effectively captures "network integration" - players in isolated clusters
can't accumulate high unique opponent counts by definition.

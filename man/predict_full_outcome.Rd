\title{Predict Full Outcome Probabilities}
\usage{
predict_full_outcome(model, delivery_data, format = c("t20", "odi", "test"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{XGBoost model object from load_full_model()}

\item{delivery_data}{Data frame of deliveries with required features.
Must include all context, player, team, and venue skill features.}

\item{format}{Character. Format type: "t20", "odi", or "test"}
}
\value{
Matrix with 7 columns representing probabilities for each outcome:
col1=P(wicket), col2=P(0 runs), col3=P(1 run), col4=P(2 runs),
col5=P(3 runs), col6=P(4 runs), col7=P(6 runs)
}
\description{
Generates outcome probability predictions using the full model with all features.
Returns a matrix of 7-class probabilities (wicket, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 runs).

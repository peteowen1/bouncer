\title{Apply Batch Propagation to Player ELOs}
\usage{
apply_player_elo_propagation(
  player_elos,
  delivery_results,
  player_opponents,
  player_events,
  player_matchups,
  propagation_factor = PLAYER_PROPAGATION_FACTOR,
  correlation_threshold = PLAYER_CORR_THRESHOLD
)
}
\arguments{
\item{player_elos}{Named list with run_elo and wicket_elo for each player}

\item{delivery_results}{Data frame with delivery-level ELO updates}

\item{player_opponents}{List of opponent history}

\item{player_events}{List of event history}

\item{player_matchups}{List of matchup counts}

\item{propagation_factor}{How much of update to propagate (default 0.15)}

\item{correlation_threshold}{Min correlation to propagate (default 0.1)}
}
\value{
Updated player_elos list
}
\description{
High-level function that applies propagation for both run and wicket ELO.
Typically called after initial ELO calculation is complete.

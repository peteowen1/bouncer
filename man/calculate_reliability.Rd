\title{Calculate Reliability Score}
\usage{
calculate_reliability(balls, halflife = THREE_WAY_RELIABILITY_HALFLIFE)
}
\arguments{
\item{balls}{Integer. Number of balls faced/bowled.}

\item{halflife}{Numeric. Balls until 50\% reliability.
Default uses package constant THREE_WAY_RELIABILITY_HALFLIFE (500).}
}
\value{
Numeric. Reliability score between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Computes reliability (confidence) in a player's rating based on sample size.
Uses a hyperbolic formula where reliability approaches 1 asymptotically.
}
\details{
Formula: reliability = balls / (balls + halflife)

At halflife balls, reliability = 0.5 (50\% weight on raw ELO).
This is mathematically equivalent to a Bayesian prior centered at replacement level.

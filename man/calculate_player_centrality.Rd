\title{Calculate Player Network Centrality from Database}
\usage{
calculate_player_centrality(
  conn,
  format = "t20",
  gender = "male",
  min_deliveries = CENTRALITY_MIN_DELIVERIES,
  alpha = CENTRALITY_ALPHA,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{DBI connection to the bouncer database.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format: "t20", "odi", "test", or "all".}

\item{gender}{Character. Gender filter: "male", "female", or "all".}

\item{min_deliveries}{Integer. Minimum deliveries for inclusion.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Opsahl's alpha parameter (default 0.5 = geometric mean).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages.}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item batters: Data frame with batter centrality results
\item bowlers: Data frame with bowler centrality results
\item matrices: The underlying matchup matrices
\item algorithm: Algorithm metadata (format, gender, alpha)
}
}
\description{
High-level function that loads delivery data from the database and computes
network centrality quality scores for all players. This is the preferred
method over PageRank as it better separates elite players from isolated clusters.

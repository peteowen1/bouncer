}
\arguments{
\item{agnostic_wicket}{Numeric. Base wicket probability from agnostic model.}

\item{batter_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Batter's wicket skill index (positive = gets out more).}

\item{bowler_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Bowler's wicket skill index (positive = takes more wickets).}

\item{venue_perm_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Venue permanent wicket skill index.}

\item{venue_session_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Venue session wicket skill index.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format (unused, kept for API consistency).}

\item{gender}{Character. Gender (unused, kept for API consistency).}

\item{batter_bsr}{Numeric. Batter Survival Rate (0-1, higher = survives more)}

\item{bowler_bsi}{Numeric. Bowler Strike Index (0-1, higher = takes more wickets)}

\item{base_rate}{Numeric. Optional calibrated base wicket rate.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Expected wicket probability for this delivery

Numeric. Adjusted expected wicket probability.
}
\description{
Predicts wicket probability for a batter-bowler matchup.

Uses agnostic model as baseline with skill-based adjustments.
Skills are added DIRECTLY to probability (no weighting in prediction).
Weights are only used for distributing updates, not for prediction.
}
\details{
Formula:
expected_wicket = clamp(baseline + batter_wicket_skill + bowler_wicket_skill +
venue_perm_wicket_skill + venue_session_wicket_skill,
0.001, 0.50)

Note: Batter wicket skill is positive if they get out MORE often (bad for batter).
Bowler wicket skill is positive if they take MORE wickets (good for bowler).
Each skill represents the entity's DIRECT contribution to wicket probability.

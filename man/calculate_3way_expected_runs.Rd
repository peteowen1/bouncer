\title{Calculate 3-Way Expected Runs}
\usage{
calculate_3way_expected_runs(
  agnostic_runs,
  batter_run_elo,
  bowler_run_elo,
  venue_perm_run_elo,
  venue_session_run_elo,
  format = "t20",
  gender = "male"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agnostic_runs}{Numeric. Base expected runs from agnostic model.
Use per-delivery values from agnostic_predictions table for best results.}

\item{batter_run_elo}{Numeric. Batter's run ELO.}

\item{bowler_run_elo}{Numeric. Bowler's run ELO.}

\item{venue_perm_run_elo}{Numeric. Venue's permanent run ELO.}

\item{venue_session_run_elo}{Numeric. Venue's session run ELO.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format: "t20", "odi", or "test".}

\item{gender}{Character. Gender: "male" or "female". Default "male".}
}
\value{
Numeric. Adjusted expected runs.
}
\description{
Uses agnostic model as baseline with ELO-based adjustments from
batter, bowler, and venue ratings.
}
\details{
The \code{agnostic_runs} parameter should come from pre-computed per-delivery
baselines (see \code{get_agnostic_baselines()}) which account for match context
and league characteristics. This enables league-specific expected values.

Supports two conversion modes (controlled by THREE_WAY_USE_LOGISTIC_CONVERSION):
\itemize{
\item Linear (default): expected = baseline + weighted_elo_diff * runs_per_elo
\item Logistic: expected = baseline * logistic_multiplier(weighted_elo_diff)
}
}

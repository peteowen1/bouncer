\title{Decay RD During Inactivity}
\usage{
glicko_decay_rd(
  rd,
  days_inactive,
  decay_per_day = GLICKO_RD_DECAY_PER_DAY,
  rd_max = GLICKO_RD_MAX
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rd}{Numeric. Current Rating Deviation.}

\item{days_inactive}{Integer. Days since last match.}

\item{decay_per_day}{Numeric. RD growth rate per day.}

\item{rd_max}{Numeric. Maximum RD cap.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Decayed (increased) RD.
}
\description{
When a player hasn't played, uncertainty increases (we're less sure
their rating still reflects their current ability).
}
\details{
Formula: new_RD = sqrt(old_RD² + decay_rate² * days_inactive)
}

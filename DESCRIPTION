Description: Cricket analytics featuring a 5-component prediction pipeline with
    ball-by-ball skill tracking. Combines a 3-Way Elo system (batter, bowler,
    venue) with residual-based skill indices built on 'XGBoost' context models.
    Provides match simulation, score projection, pre-match win probability, and
    'PageRank' network quality adjustment across T20, ODI, and Test formats.
    Includes data management functions to download and parse cricket data from
    'Cricsheet', storing it in a 'DuckDB' database for efficient querying.

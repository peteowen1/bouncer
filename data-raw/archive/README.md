# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that were moved here during code cleanup because they are:
- Debug/diagnostic scripts not part of the main pipeline
- Example/demo scripts
- Superseded by newer implementations

These scripts are preserved for reference but are not actively maintained.

## Contents

- `debug_player_elo.R` - Debugging script for player ELO calculations
- `player_analysis_example.R` - Example script demonstrating player analysis
- `00_diagnose_features.R` - Feature diagnostic script for pre-match models

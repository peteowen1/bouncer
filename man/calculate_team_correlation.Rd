\arguments{
\item{team_a}{First team ID}

\item{team_b}{Second team ID}

\item{team_opponents}{List mapping team_id -> vector of opponent_ids}

\item{team_events}{List mapping team_id -> vector of event_names}

\item{team_matchups}{List mapping team_id -> list(opponent_id -> count)}

\item{w_opponents}{Weight for shared opponents (default 0.5)}

\item{w_events}{Weight for same events (default 0.3)}

\item{w_direct}{Weight for direct matches (default 0.2)}
}
\value{
Numeric correlation score between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Computes a hybrid correlation score based on:
\itemize{
\item Shared opponents (Jaccard similarity of opponent sets)
\item Same events (Jaccard similarity of event sets)
\item Direct matches (proportion of matches against each other)
}
}

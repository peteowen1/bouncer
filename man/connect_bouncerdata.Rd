\title{Connect to Bouncerdata from GitHub Releases}
\usage{
connect_bouncerdata(
  repo = "peteowen1/bouncerdata",
  tag = "latest",
  tables = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{repo}{Character. GitHub repository. Default "peteowen1/bouncerdata".}

\item{tag}{Character. Release tag to use, or "latest" for most recent weekly.}

\item{tables}{Character vector. Tables to create views for, or "all".
Available: "matches", "players", "deliveries_long_form",
"deliveries_short_form", "t20_player_skill", etc.}
}
\value{
A DuckDB connection with views for each table. Use standard
DBI functions to query (dbGetQuery, dbSendQuery, etc.).
}
\description{
Creates a DuckDB connection with views pointing to parquet files
hosted on GitHub Releases. No download required - queries run
directly against the remote files.
}
\details{
This function creates a lightweight connection that queries parquet
files directly from GitHub without downloading them first. This is
convenient for quick analyses but slower than local files for large
queries. For heavy analysis, use \code{install_parquets_from_release()}
to download files locally first.

Remember to disconnect when done: \code{DBI::dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Connect to latest data
con <- connect_bouncerdata()

# Query matches
ipl_matches <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con,
  "SELECT * FROM matches
   WHERE event_name LIKE '\%Indian Premier League\%'
   ORDER BY match_date DESC
   LIMIT 100")

# Query T20 deliveries
kohli_balls <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con,
  "SELECT * FROM deliveries_short_form
   WHERE batter_id = 'V Kohli'
   LIMIT 1000")

# Get player skill ratings
top_batters <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con,
  "SELECT * FROM t20_player_skill
   ORDER BY batter_scoring_index DESC
   LIMIT 20")

# Don't forget to disconnect!
DBI::dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
}
}

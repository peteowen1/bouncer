\title{Get Dynamic K-Factor for Run ELO}
\usage{
get_player_dynamic_k_run(deliveries, format = "t20")
}
\arguments{
\item{deliveries}{Integer. Number of deliveries the player has faced/bowled.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format: "t20", "odi", or "test".}
}
\value{
Numeric. The K-factor to use for this delivery's ELO update.
}
\description{
Calculates the K-factor for Run ELO updates based on player experience.
New players have higher K-factors (faster learning), experienced players
have lower K-factors (more stable ratings).
}
\details{
Formula: K = K_MIN + (K_MAX - K_MIN) * exp(-deliveries / K_HALFLIFE)
}
\examples{
# New player (0 deliveries) gets max K
get_player_dynamic_k_run(0, "t20")  # Returns 40

# Experienced player (1000 deliveries) gets close to min K
get_player_dynamic_k_run(1000, "t20")  # Returns ~13
}

\title{Fetch All Data for a Single Cricinfo Match}
\usage{
cricinfo_fetch_match(
  browser,
  series_id,
  match_id,
  include_commentary = FALSE,
  include_scorecard = TRUE,
  max_scrolls = 50
)
}
\arguments{
\item{browser}{A ChromoteSession object with Network enabled}

\item{series_id}{Integer series objectId}

\item{match_id}{Integer match objectId}

\item{include_commentary}{Fetch ball-by-ball commentary via scroll capture
(default FALSE). Set to TRUE for matches where you want pitch/shot/wagon data.
Commentary scraping takes ~2 minutes per match due to scrolling.}

\item{include_scorecard}{Fetch scorecard data (default TRUE)}

\item{max_scrolls}{Maximum scroll actions for commentary (default 50)}
}
\value{
List with $commentary, $scorecard, $details, $over_summaries
}
\description{
Downloads scorecard, match details, over summaries, and ball-by-ball
commentary for a single match. Uses two page loads:
\enumerate{
\item Scorecard page: extracts scorecard, details, over summaries, player map
\item Commentary page: captures ball-by-ball via scroll + CDP interception
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
browser <- chromote::ChromoteSession$new()
browser$Network$enable()
cricinfo_apply_stealth(browser)

# Fetch scorecard only (fast)
match <- cricinfo_fetch_match(browser, series_id = 1455609, match_id = 1473561)

# Fetch with ball-by-ball commentary (slower, requires scrolling)
match <- cricinfo_fetch_match(browser, series_id = 1455609, match_id = 1473561,
                              include_commentary = TRUE)
}

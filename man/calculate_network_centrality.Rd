\title{Calculate Network Centrality from Matchup Matrix}
\usage{
calculate_network_centrality(
  matchup_matrix,
  alpha = CENTRALITY_ALPHA,
  mean_type = CENTRALITY_MEAN_TYPE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matchup_matrix}{Matrix of delivery counts (batter x bowler).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Weight for opponent quality vs own breadth.
\itemize{
\item alpha = 0: pure degree centrality (just count unique opponents)
\item alpha = 0.8: quality-weighted (recommended for arithmetic)
\item alpha = 1: pure neighbor degree (only opponent quality matters)
}}

\item{mean_type}{Character. "arithmetic" (recommended) or "geometric".}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item batter_centrality: Named vector of centrality scores for batters
\item bowler_centrality: Named vector of centrality scores for bowlers
\item batter_unique_opps: Named vector of unique bowler counts
\item bowler_unique_opps: Named vector of unique batter counts
\item batter_avg_opp_degree: Named vector of average bowler degree for each batter
\item bowler_avg_opp_degree: Named vector of average batter degree for each bowler
}
}
\description{
Computes weighted degree centrality for batters and bowlers using either
arithmetic or geometric mean. This replaces the iterative PageRank algorithm
with a simpler, theoretically grounded measure that better separates elite
players from isolated clusters.
}
\details{
Two mean types are supported:
\itemize{
\item arithmetic: (1-alpha)\emph{degree + alpha}avg_opp_degree (RECOMMENDED)
\item geometric:  degree^(1-alpha) * avg_opp_degree^alpha (Opsahl's original)
}

Arithmetic mean is recommended because it gives immediate boost to players
in elite leagues even with few appearances. A new IPL player facing 4
bowlers with avg 300-degree gets ~241 centrality vs ~35 with geometric.

Why this works better than PageRank:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Theoretical grounding}: Based on Opsahl et al. (2010)'s work on node
centrality in weighted networks. The geometric mean balances breadth
(how many opponents) with quality (how connected those opponents are).
\item \strong{Separation}: PageRank converges to similar values (~5\% variation) in
cricket's highly connected network. Centrality produces 90+ percentile
point gaps between elite and isolated players.
\item \strong{Computational efficiency}: O(n) instead of O(iterations x n^2).
\item \strong{Per-delivery fairness}: A player facing 100 opponents across IPL, BBL,
and T20 World Cup scores high because those opponents have high degrees.
A player facing 100 opponents all from the same isolated league scores
low because those opponents have low degrees.

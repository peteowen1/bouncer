\arguments{
\item{all_player_ids}{Vector of all player IDs}

\item{player_opponents}{List of opponent history}

\item{player_events}{List of event history}

\item{player_matchups}{List of matchup counts}

\item{threshold}{Minimum correlation to include (default 0.1)}

\item{w_opponents}{Weight for shared opponents}

\item{w_events}{Weight for same events}

\item{w_direct}{Weight for direct matches}
}
\value{
Sparse matrix (list of lists) with correlations > threshold
}
\description{
Efficiently builds a sparse correlation matrix for all players at once.
Uses vectorized operations where possible.

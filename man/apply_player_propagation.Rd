\title{Apply Player ELO Propagation Post-Processing}
\usage{
apply_player_propagation(
  player_elos,
  delivery_results,
  correlation_matrix,
  propagation_factor = PLAYER_PROPAGATION_FACTOR,
  elo_type = "run"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{player_elos}{Named list with run_elo and wicket_elo for each player}

\item{delivery_results}{Data frame with batter_id, bowler_id, run_update, wicket_update}

\item{correlation_matrix}{Pre-computed sparse correlation matrix}

\item{propagation_factor}{How much of update to propagate (default 0.15)}

\item{elo_type}{"run" or "wicket" to select which ELO to propagate}
}
\value{
Updated player_elos list
}
\description{
Applies ELO propagation as a post-processing step using pre-computed
correlation matrix. This anchors isolated player pools to the main pool.
}
\details{
For run ELO:
\itemize{
\item When a batter scores (wins the delivery), correlated batters adjust up
\item When a bowler concedes runs (loses), correlated bowlers adjust down
}

For wicket ELO:
\itemize{
\item When a batter survives (wins), correlated batters adjust up
\item When a bowler gets a wicket (wins), correlated bowlers adjust up
}
}

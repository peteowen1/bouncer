\title{Load Full Outcome Model}
\usage{
load_full_model(format = c("t20", "odi", "test"), model_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{Character. Format type: "t20", "odi", or "test"}

\item{model_dir}{Character. Directory where models are stored.
If NULL (default), automatically finds bouncerdata/models directory.}
}
\value{
Loaded XGBoost model object (xgb.Booster)
}
\description{
Loads the trained full outcome prediction model for a given format.
The full model uses all available features including player skills,
team skills, and venue skills for maximum prediction accuracy.
}
\details{
The full model uses all available features:
\itemize{
\item Context: over, ball, wickets, runs_diff, phase, innings, format, gender
\item Player skills: batter/bowler scoring/survival/economy/strike rate
\item Team skills: batting/bowling team runs/wicket skill
\item Venue skills: run rate, wicket rate, boundary rate, dot rate
}

This is the model used for match simulation where maximum accuracy is needed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load T20 full model
model <- load_full_model("t20")

# Predict on delivery data with all skill features
probs <- predict_full_outcome(model, deliveries, format = "t20")
}
}

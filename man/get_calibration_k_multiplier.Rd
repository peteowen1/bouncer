\title{Calculate Calibration K-Factor Multiplier}
\usage{
get_calibration_k_multiplier(
  calibration_score,
  k_boost = THREE_WAY_CALIBRATION_K_BOOST
)
}
\arguments{
\item{calibration_score}{Numeric. Player's calibration score (0-100).
Higher = more exposure to anchor leagues.}

\item{k_boost}{Numeric. Maximum K boost for completely uncalibrated players.
Default uses package constant THREE_WAY_CALIBRATION_K_BOOST.}
}
\value{
Numeric. K-factor multiplier (1.0 to 1 + k_boost).
}
\description{
Adjusts K-factor based on player calibration score.
Uncalibrated players (low score) get higher K to learn faster from
calibrated opponents. Calibrated players keep normal K.
}
\details{
Formula:
calibration_mult = 1 + (1 - calibration_score / 100) * k_boost

Examples:
\itemize{
\item calibration_score = 0: K multiplier = 1 + k_boost (max boost)
\item calibration_score = 50: K multiplier = 1 + 0.5 * k_boost
\item calibration_score = 100: K multiplier = 1 (no boost)
}

\title{Calculate Expected Runs per Ball}
\usage{
calculate_expected_runs_per_ball(
  projected_score,
  current_runs,
  balls_remaining
)
}
\arguments{
\item{projected_score}{Numeric. Projected final innings score}

\item{current_runs}{Numeric. Runs scored so far}

\item{balls_remaining}{Numeric. Balls left in innings}
}
\value{
Numeric. Expected runs per ball (capped between 0 and 6)
}
\description{
Calculates the expected runs for each ball based on the projected final score
and current state. This is used for ERA (Expected Runs Added) calculations.
}
\details{
Works for both innings:
\itemize{
\item Innings 1: How many runs per ball needed to reach projected score
\item Innings 2: How many runs per ball needed to reach projected score (and hopefully target)
}
}
\examples{
# Early in innings: projected 170, scored 30, 90 balls left
calculate_expected_runs_per_ball(170, 30, 90)
# Returns: (170 - 30) / 90 = 1.56 expected runs per ball

# Late in innings: projected 165, scored 140, 12 balls left
calculate_expected_runs_per_ball(165, 140, 12)
# Returns: (165 - 140) / 12 = 2.08 expected runs per ball
}

\title{Get 3-Way Player K-Factor}
\usage{
get_3way_player_k(
  deliveries,
  days_inactive = 0,
  format = "t20",
  elo_type = "run",
  phase = "middle",
  is_knockout = FALSE,
  event_tier = 2,
  is_high_chase = FALSE,
  calibration_score = NULL,
  use_player_tier_k = FALSE,
  opponent_centrality_percentile = NULL,
  gender = "male"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deliveries}{Integer. Player's total deliveries faced/bowled.}

\item{days_inactive}{Integer. Days since player's last match.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format: "t20", "odi", or "test".}

\item{elo_type}{Character. "run" or "wicket".}

\item{phase}{Character. Match phase: "powerplay", "middle", or "death".}

\item{is_knockout}{Logical. Whether this is a knockout match.}

\item{event_tier}{Integer. Event tier (1-4).}

\item{is_high_chase}{Logical. Whether this is a high-pressure chase.}

\item{calibration_score}{Numeric. Player's calibration score (0-100).
NULL uses no calibration adjustment (backward compatible).}

\item{use_player_tier_k}{Logical. Use player-level tier K multipliers
(more aggressive) instead of standard tier multipliers.}

\item{opponent_centrality_percentile}{Numeric. Opponent's centrality percentile (0-100).
If provided, applies sigmoid-based K-factor modulation where:
\itemize{
\item 99th percentile → K × 1.5 (learn a lot from elite)
\item 50th percentile → K × 1.0 (neutral)
\item 10th percentile → K × 0.5 (learn little from weak)
NULL or NA uses no centrality adjustment (backward compatible).
}}

\item{gender}{Character. Gender: "male" or "female". Default "male".}
}
\value{
Numeric. The final adjusted K-factor.
}
\description{
Calculates dynamic K-factor for a player based on experience and context.
Includes calibration-based scaling where uncalibrated players (low anchor
exposure) get higher K to learn faster from calibrated opponents.
}
\details{
Now also supports centrality-based K-factor modulation (Option A):
\itemize{
\item High centrality opponents → higher K (learn more from elite players)
\item Low centrality opponents → lower K (learn less from weak players)
}
}

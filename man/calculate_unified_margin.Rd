\usage{
calculate_unified_margin(
  team1_score,
  team2_score,
  wickets_remaining = 0,
  overs_remaining = 0,
  win_type = "runs",
  format = "t20",
  super_over_margin = NULL,
  gender = "male",
  team_type = "international"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{team1_score}{Integer. Team 1's total (batting first or only innings).}

\item{team2_score}{Integer. Team 2's total when match ended.}

\item{wickets_remaining}{Integer. Wickets in hand when match ended (0 for runs wins).
This is how results are reported: "won by 6 wickets" means wickets_remaining=6.}

\item{overs_remaining}{Numeric. Overs remaining in cricket notation (e.g., 2.3 = 2 overs + 3 balls).
This is how results are reported: "with 2.3 overs to spare" means overs_remaining=2.3.}

\item{win_type}{Character. "runs", "wickets", "tie", or "draw".}

\item{format}{Character. Match format: "t20", "odi", or "test".}

\item{super_over_margin}{Integer. If match had Super Over, the run difference (optional).}

\item{gender}{Character. "male" or "female".}

\item{team_type}{Character. "international" or "club".}
}
\value{
Numeric. Unified margin in runs-equivalent.
Positive = team1 won, Negative = team2 won, 0 = tie/draw
}
\description{
Converts all match outcomes to a runs-equivalent margin.
Positive margin = team1 won, negative margin = team2 won.
}
\details{
For runs wins: margin = team1_score - team2_score
For wickets wins: project team2's final score using optimized projection,
then calculate difference.

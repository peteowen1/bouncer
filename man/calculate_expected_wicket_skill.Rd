\title{Calculate Expected Wicket Probability (Skill Index)}
\usage{
calculate_expected_wicket_skill(
  agnostic_wicket,
  batter_wicket_skill,
  bowler_wicket_skill,
  venue_perm_wicket_skill,
  venue_session_wicket_skill,
  format = "t20",
  gender = "male"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agnostic_wicket}{Numeric. Base wicket probability from agnostic model.}

\item{batter_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Batter's wicket skill index (positive = gets out more).}

\item{bowler_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Bowler's wicket skill index (positive = takes more wickets).}

\item{venue_perm_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Venue permanent wicket skill index.}

\item{venue_session_wicket_skill}{Numeric. Venue session wicket skill index.}

\item{format}{Character. Match format (unused, kept for API consistency).}

\item{gender}{Character. Gender (unused, kept for API consistency).}
}
\value{
Numeric. Adjusted expected wicket probability.
}
\description{
Uses agnostic model as baseline with skill-based adjustments.
Skills are added DIRECTLY to probability (no weighting in prediction).
Weights are only used for distributing updates, not for prediction.
}
\details{
Formula:
expected_wicket = clamp(baseline + batter_wicket_skill + bowler_wicket_skill +
venue_perm_wicket_skill + venue_session_wicket_skill,
0.001, 0.50)

NOTE: Wicket skills use OPPOSITE sign convention from run skills.
Run skills:    positive = good for entity (batter scores more / bowler restricts more)
Wicket skills: positive = higher wicket probability for BOTH (bad for batter, good for bowler)
This is intentional - each skill represents DIRECT contribution to wicket probability.

Batter wicket skill is positive if they get out MORE often (bad for batter).
Bowler wicket skill is positive if they take MORE wickets (good for bowler).

\title{Predict Win Probability from Current Game State}
\usage{
predict_win_probability(
  current_score,
  wickets,
  overs,
  innings,
  target = NULL,
  format = "t20",
  venue_stats = NULL,
  skill_adjustments = NULL,
  models = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_score}{Integer. Current team score.}

\item{wickets}{Integer. Wickets fallen (0-10).}

\item{overs}{Numeric. Overs bowled in cricket notation (e.g., 10.3 = 10 overs + 3 balls).}

\item{innings}{Integer. Current innings (1 or 2).}

\item{target}{Integer. Target score (required if innings = 2).}

\item{format}{Character. Match format: "t20", "odi".}

\item{venue_stats}{List. Venue-specific statistics (optional).
If NULL, uses format averages.}

\item{skill_adjustments}{List. Team/player skill adjustments (optional).}

\item{models}{List. Pre-loaded models from load_in_match_models().
If NULL, models are loaded automatically.}
}
\value{
A \code{bouncer_win_prob} object containing:
\itemize{
\item win_prob - Win probability for batting-first team (0-1)
\item projected_score - Projected final innings score
\item current_score - Input current score
\item wickets - Input wickets fallen
\item overs - Input overs bowled
\item innings - Input innings number
\item format - Match format
\item method - "model" (2nd innings) or "heuristic" (1st innings)
}
}
\description{
Calculate win probability for the batting-first team given the current
match state. Uses scoreboard-friendly inputs.
}
\note{
First-innings win probability uses a linear heuristic based on
projected score vs venue par. Second-innings uses the full Stage 2 model.

\dontrun{
# First innings: India 85/2 after 10 overs
wp <- predict_win_probability(85, 2, 10.0, innings = 1, format = "t20")

# Second innings: Chasing 180, currently 100/3 after 12.4 overs
wp <- predict_win_probability(100, 3, 12.4, innings = 2, target = 180, format = "t20")

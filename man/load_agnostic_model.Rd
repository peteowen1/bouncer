\title{Load Agnostic Outcome Model}
\usage{
load_agnostic_model(format = c("t20", "odi", "test"), model_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{Character. Format type: "t20", "odi", or "test"}

\item{model_dir}{Character. Directory where models are stored.
If NULL (default), automatically finds bouncerdata/models directory.}
}
\value{
Loaded XGBoost model object (xgb.Booster)
}
\description{
Loads the trained agnostic outcome prediction model for a given format.
The agnostic model predicts delivery outcomes using only context features,
serving as the baseline for residual-based skill index calculations.
}
\details{
The agnostic model differs from the full model in that it uses ONLY
context features (match state) with no player/team/venue information.
This makes it suitable for calculating baseline expectations, where
actual performance minus expected gives the "skill residual".
